# Simple Browser RPG Demo

A small browser-based RPG demo built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic character classes, simple game logic, and DOM-based UI for a minimal playable prototype.

## Features
- Basic character classes: Monk, Warrior, Wizard
- Simple game loop and interactions
- Modular JS files for each character and game logic

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (no server required).

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/style.css` — styles
- `js/game.js` — main game logic and initialization
- `js/character.js` — base character class
- `js/monk.js` — monk class
- `js/warrior.js` — warrior class
- `js/wizard.js` — wizard class

## Development
- Edit the JS files in `js/` to add behaviors or balance characters.
- Use the browser DevTools console to inspect game state and debug logic.
